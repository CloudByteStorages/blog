## Observation:

- View **/etc/cinder/cinder.conf**

  ```
  
  [database]
  idle_timeout=3600
  max_pool_size=10
  max_retries=-1
  max_overflow=30
  connection=mysql:///cinder:FCv56ZEZ@198.18.16.2/cinder?charset=utf8&read_timeout=60
  
  ```
  
- Ping the Ip
  
  ```
  
  ping to 198.18.16.2 worked fine.
  
  ```


## Solution :

- There were three slashes **‘///’**. Removed the extra **/** present in the connection.
- Below is the correct value for connection.
  
  ```
  
  connection=mysql://cinder:FCv56ZEZ@198.18.16.2/cinder?charset=utf8&read_timeout=60
  
  ```
