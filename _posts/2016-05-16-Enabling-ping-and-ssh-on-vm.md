## Observation :

- You need to enable ping and ssh on your VMs for network access. This can be done with either the nova or euca2ools commands.

## Steps to follow :

- Run these commands as root only if the credentials used to interact with nova-api are in **/root/.bashrc**. 
- If the EC2 credentials in the **.bashrc** file are for an unprivileged user, you must run these commands as that user instead.
- Enable ping and SSH with nova commands:
  
  ```
  $ nova secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 -1 0.0.0.0/0
  $ nova secgroup-add-rule default tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0           
  ```

- Enable ping and SSH with euca2ools:
  
  ```
  $ euca-authorize -P icmp -t -1:-1 -s 0.0.0.0/0 default
  $ euca-authorize -P tcp -p 22 -s 0.0.0.0/0 default         
  ```

- If you have run these commands and still cannot ping or SSH your instances, check the number of running dnsmasq processes, there should be two. 
- If not, kill the processes and restart the service with these commands: command:
  
  ```
  # killall dnsmasq
  # service nova-network restart
  ```

- Enable RDP for the above things to work:
  
  - Go to Access & Security and select  Security Groups
  - In the Security Groups section select default groupâ€™s Manage Rules

  - In Manage rules add a new rule as follows and save it
