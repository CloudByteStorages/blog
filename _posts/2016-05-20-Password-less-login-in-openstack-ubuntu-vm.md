## Steps to follow :

- Create a ssh-key pair in access & security in the fuel master node (where you would have logged in as a specific user)

- How to create a key pair ?

  ```
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -f cloud.key
  ```

- This will create e.g. **cloud.key** & **cloud.key.pub**

- Now open up the Horizon & Import the public key (**cloud.key.pub**) that was generated by above step.
â€‹
- Launch a new Instance associating this public key.

- In the fuel master node terminal, login to Ubuntu VM using the private key.
  
  ```
  ssh -i cloud.key ubuntu@instance_ip
  ```
