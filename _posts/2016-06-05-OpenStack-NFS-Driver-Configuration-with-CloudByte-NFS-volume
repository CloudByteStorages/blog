# Introduction

  The Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984. An NFS server
  exports one or more of its file systems, known as shares. An NFS client can mount these exported shares on its own file system. You can
  perform file actions on this mounted remote file system as if the file system were local.

### NFS driver notes

- cinder-volume manages the mounting of the NFS shares as well as volume creation on the shares. Keep this in mind when planning your
  OpenStack architecture. If you have one master NFS server, it might make sense to only have one cinder-volume service to handle all
  requests to that NFS server. However, if that single server is unable to handle all requests, more than one cinder-volume service is
  needed as well as potentially more than one NFS server.

- Because data is stored in a file and not actually on a block storage device, you might not see the same IO performance as you would 
  with a traditional block storage driver. Please test accordingly.

- Despite possible IO performance loss, having volume data stored in a file might be beneficial. For example, backing up volumes can be 
  as easy as copying the volume files.
  
# Configuration steps 

In order to configure the CloudByte NFS volume against OpenStack NFS driver we need to follow few steps:

- Firstly create a NFS volume in CloudByte ElastiStor with some goos specifictions. For eg, 20 GB.
- Now set the **NFS client configuration** to the OpenStack setup machine.
